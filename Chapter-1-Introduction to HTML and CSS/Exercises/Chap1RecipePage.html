            <li>In a bowl, add 240ml of warm milk, 5 tbsp of granulated sugar and 2 and 1 quarter grams of active dry yeast and mix before letting it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, add 580g of bread flour, 80g of brown sugar, 1 and 1/5 tsp of salt and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon before mixing and adding it to the first bowl. </li>
            <li>Back in the first bowl, add 115g of salted melted butter, 1 large egg and 1 tbsp of vanilla extract before using a mixer on low speed until it becomes a shaggy mixture. Then, increase the speed and mix until it becomes smooth, silky, and doesn't stick to your fingers.</li>
            <li>Add the dough to a well oiled bowl and let it rest in a warm place until doubled in size.</li>
            <li> Put the risen dough on a lightly flour'd counter and roll it out into a rectangle by patting and shaping it.</li>
            <li>Create a dry mixture of cinnamon, brown sugar, and cocoa powder. The ratio of the ingredients can be adjusted to your preference.</li>
            <li>Spread out some warm, but not melting, butter over it evenly before covering it with the mixture.</li>
            <li> Roll the dough as evenly as you can and cut the roll into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> Add the pieces to a tray with plenty of space in between as they will grow in size in the oven.</li>
            <li> Take it out when golden and colour and enjoy while its warm! </li>
