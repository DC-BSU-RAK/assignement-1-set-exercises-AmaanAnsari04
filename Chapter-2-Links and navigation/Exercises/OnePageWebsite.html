Fortune hunter Nathan Drake is catapulted headlong into an adventure that takes him on a daring trek into the heart of the Arabian Desert in a search for the fabled "Atlantis of the Sands." 
This journey pits him and his mentor Victor Sullivan against the occult treachery of a shadowy clandestine organization and its ruthless leader.
When the terrible secrets of this lost city are unearthed, Drake's quest descends into a desperate bid for survival that strains the limits of his endurance and forces him to confront his deepest fears.

<p>"It's more than just the best entry in an outstanding series though - it epitomises the very reason many of us play video games. And that's its greatest achievement." - <b>Push Square</b></p>
<p>"From start to finish, single player to multiplayer, this game sings. The characters, the graphics, the sound, the story â€“ they're all top notch. If you're willing to skip Uncharted 3, be prepared to miss one of gaming's finest moments." - <b>IGN</b></p>
<p>"Overall, the combination of a robust multiplayer, a surprisingly compelling co-op adventure, and a thrilling ten-hour single-player campaign add up to a title that is, quite simply, a must-own" - <b>GamePro</b></p>
